The basic idea of this adjoint tomography package is:
1. all the run_*.sh are scripts for preparation.
2. pbs_*.sh are PBS scripts for computing
3.  submit* are scripts sumbit pbs jobs

Note:
1. remember to test the the scripts for one station before large number of simulations
2. You might need to change the SACAUX in seis_process/*.pl
3. Remember to change WINDOWS.PAR according to your data type
4. How to get volumic kernel coverage ??
   set DO_RAY_DENSITY_SOURCE=.true. in measure_adj/ma_constants.f90
   then the adjoint source are constructed with dt=1 or dlnA=1 (check $15,$16 of window_chi)
